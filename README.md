# Objective
Aims to periodically reads over IR the register of a Landis+Gyr E230 Power Meter and displays some statistics in a console app

## Side objectives

- Realize a clean and proper C# console application.
- Submit the read data to a <http://www.volkszaehler.org/> instance hosted on Synology using Docker.

# Material used

- Using an IR Reader ()
- Using a RaspberryPi ()
- Using a 3.2-inch HAT-Screen ()

# Principle

1. Triggers a read using
 ```echo -n -e '\x2F\x3F\x21\x0D\x0A' > /dev/ttyUSB0```
2. Reads the output into a ```C#``` application
 _manually the output can be read while having run this command before chating with the unit._
 ```cat /dev/ttyUSB0```
3. At first the application will only show the latest values. The statistics will be added later on.

# Sample Output

This output has been read using the `cat`-command.

# Python Implementation

To ease the string-processing and posting results to http-based API I transform the bash-base sample into a python application.
